# Celda: A Bayesian model to perform bi-clustering of genes into modules and cells into subpopulations using single-cell RNA-seq data

**Celda** (**Ce**llular **L**atent **D**irichlet **A**llocation) is a discrete Bayesian hierarchical model to simultaneously perform bi-clustering of genes into modules and cells into subpopulations for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) count data. This repository contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the results in the publication. 

## Repository Structure

* R folder contains all the R scripts which generates the results and figures.
* Data folder contains R objects in RDS formats.
* Figures folder contains all the figures in PDF format generated by all the scripts in R folder.

## How to regenerate the results

Since the R objects required for each step have already been stored in the Data folder, all R scripts can be run separatelly in a orderless fashion. If you want to regenerate the results without the use of pre-generated R objects, try executing the scripts in this order:
**package_environment.R** → **pbmc4kdec.R** → **FigureS1.R** → **Other .R files**
